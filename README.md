# b9lab Splitter

This is the first project of the Community Blockstars 2019 - Ethereum Developer Course.

You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

* There are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
* We can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
* Whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
* We can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
* Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.
* Add unit tests
